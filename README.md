COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization
This project analyzes and visualizes global COVID-19 data, focusing on trends in cases, deaths, vaccinations, and their distribution across countries. The analysis includes cleaning raw data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), generating insightful visualizations, and building choropleth maps to highlight global trends.

Objectives:
Data Collection & Cleaning: Load and preprocess raw COVID-19 data from reliable sources.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform statistical analysis and visualize trends such as daily new cases, deaths, and vaccination progress.

Visualization: Generate interactive and static plots, including line charts, bar charts, and choropleth maps to compare countries and continents.

Insights: Identify key insights from the analysis to inform decisions about vaccination rollouts, trends in case density, and the impact of public health measures.

Tools & Libraries Used:
Python Libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

matplotlib: For basic plotting and visualizations.

seaborn: For enhanced statistical data visualizations.

plotly: For interactive choropleth maps and advanced visualizations.

numpy: For numerical computations and handling missing data.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and visualization.

How to Run/View the Project:
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid-19-analysis.git
cd covid-19-analysis
Install Dependencies:
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Start a Jupyter Notebook session:
jupyter notebook
Open the relevant .ipynb file in your browser and begin the analysis.

View Visualizations:
The notebook includes various visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and choropleth maps. You can interact with them directly in the Jupyter interface.

Insights & Reflections:
Vaccination Rollouts: Countries like the USA and India showed rapid vaccination progress, while many African countries faced challenges in vaccination coverage.

Case Trends: Waves of new cases followed a pattern across different countries, with the USA seeing the highest cases per million, highlighting the disparity in case spread.

Death Rates: The death rate varied significantly, with the USA showing higher rates early in the pandemic. This was likely influenced by healthcare infrastructure and reporting methods.

Geographic Insights: Choropleth maps revealed stark differences between high-income and low-income countries in terms of both cases and vaccinations, underscoring the need for global health equity.
